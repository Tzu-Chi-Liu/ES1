# Input file: input.txt 
In this folder you will find subfolders with names corresponding to the ones listed in the `Simulation problems`, and in each problem subfolder contains a folder named `<problem_name>/EXAMPLE/`.  The `<problem_name>/EXAMPLE/inputs` folder is an example for what a input folder should look like.

DON'T MODIFY THIS FOLDER UNLESS THE CODE IS ALSO CHANGED!!!

Use `cp -r EXAMPLE/ <name_of_your_simulation>/` to copy the entire folder.
Then set the parameters of your simulation in the `<name_of_your_simulation>/input.txt` file.
The simulation results will also be stored in the `<name_of_your_simulation>` folder.
